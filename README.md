# BPL-Information-Query
A File I/O based console application developed in C programming language that let users query for useful information such as team information, player information, rankings, searching, individual performance etc. about  Bangladesh Premier League (BPL), a T20 Cricket tournament. This is developed as part of my Software Development Project-I. There are two versions of the application: 
1. Static: Uses static arrays, arrays of structures.
2. Dynamic : Uses dynmaic arrays, arrays of structures using pointers arithmetic. It was instructed by my professor to replace the application by pointer arithmetic and upon success provided a key evidence for the validity of my work.
